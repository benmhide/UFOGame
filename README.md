# UFO-Game
The task was to build a new game by extending the UFO example game you built during workshops.
Many requirements and features of the game are pre-defined (below), but within those parameters
we were free to add components, game mechanics, and ideas, in order to produce a fun and well polished game experience.

Eliciting and using feedback from players was an important part of the game creation proess.
We had to follow a specific and structured process for collecting user feedback, and to explain how the feedback
was used to improve the game.

Required game features:
The game had to extend the original UFO game by adding the following features:
1. The game should have enemies which can be shot and killed.
2. There should be more than one kind of enemy.
3. The playing area had to be extended.
4. Enemies should be able to attack and kill the player.
5. An game end condition had to be clearly defined.
6. The game had to increase in difficulty as play develops.
